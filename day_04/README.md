# Day Four - Span and Div elements in HTML 

## What I learned
- Span is an inline element used to wrap a section of text or inline elements.
It is used to apply styles such as:
1. color
2. font size
3. background color 
to a specific part of a text without affecting the rest of the text 

- Div is a block level element used to group elements together.
It is used to create container for other elements making it easier to apply
1. styles
2. layout and
3. structure 
to a section of a text
