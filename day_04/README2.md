# Day Four - Lists in HTML 

## What I learned
- Lists are used to present a collection of items in a structured way. 
- Lists are used for presenting information in a clear and organized way.
There are 3 types and these are:
1. Unordered list:
a list with bullet points, used for items that dont need to be in a specific order.

2. Ordered list:
a list with numbered items, used for items that need to be in a specific order.

3. Definition list:
a list of terms with definitions, used for glossaries or dictionaries.
